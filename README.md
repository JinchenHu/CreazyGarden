For this assignment you will program Crazy Nancyâ€™s garden Game. The winner of the game is the player (called gardener from now on) who fills up his/her garden with flowers and trees the first. There are no ties in this game. This game requires luck with the dice and a bit of strategy

Rules of the game:
1. Number of players: 2 to 10
2. Garden size: N x N, where N is at least 3
3. Each player has a garden board which is empty when they start the game. A player can plant either a flower which takes up one square or a tree which takes up 4 squares (2 x 2).
4. The game works as follows:
  a) Determine who goes 1 st : each player rolls 2 dice. The player with the highest roll goes first. However if any player rolls the same      total, this process starts over again.
  b) Each player has a turn until there is a winner. During his/her turn a player:
    a. Rolls the 2 dice.
    b. Based on the outcome gets to plant a pre-set number of trees and/or flowers.
  c)It is possible that a player does not have enough room left in his/her garden to plant a tree in which case the player looses a turn.       It is also possible that a player fills his/her garden before finishing his/her turn when they have 2 items to plant. If this happens       then they are declared the winner.
